A Luggage feature that contains user experience add-ons

#UX Add-ons

###Block Filtering

The block filter add-on places a text input box within each block that has a list, and is over 7 items in length. As the user types characters, the block's list will live filter.

###Block Collapsing

The block collapse add-on allows the user to collapse blocks upon the click of the block header.

###Tag Boxing

The tag boxing add-on takes the comma delimited tag input in a taxonomy term reference field and creates removable boxes.
